## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header = TRUE,
                 sep = ",") 
# drop rows missing steps
data2<-data[!is.na(data$steps),]

# get date into date format
data2$date<-as.Date(as.character(data2$date,''),'%Y-%m-%d')

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
step_day<-with(data2,aggregate(steps,by=list(date),sum,na.rm=TRUE))
names(step_day)<-c("date","steps")
hist(step_day$steps)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
